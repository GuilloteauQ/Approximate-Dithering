ok, it's time to put some idea on the "paper" to not forget them.

there are several things to inverstigate:

- image ratio: width vs height
  - maybe in some cases it is intersting to skip some error diffusion in some direction
- ratio of skip lines and columns 
- try to make the code so that it can be used by snakemake later on
- if bored, we can try to dither a "video" and use control or something to regulate the speed/quality


Branchless:
- could have a single cell at pixels[0] to put all the crap


-  implement a enum for CLI and each solutions
- pass an image to compare to ?
